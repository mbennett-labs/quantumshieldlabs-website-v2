        title: "Why A16Z's Quantum Security Report Should Alarm Healthcare More Than Crypto",
        date: "2025-12-23",
        author: "Michael Bennett",
        category: "Quantum Threat Analysis",
        excerpt: "Andreessen Horowitz just released a quantum threat assessment that's reshaping how crypto thinks about Q-Day. But here's what nobody's discussing: these findings apply MORE urgently to healthcare than to blockchain. The 'harvest now, decrypt later' attack is already happening—and medical records made the list.",
